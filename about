Hello, this is my first project as well as first repository on GitHub.
I am a noob in this field, and this project is the result of me trying to explore the field of Data Science through Python.
I tried hard to make the code beautiful by making it self explanatory to a level and adding comments at places.


This project deals with Covid 19 Analysis of United States, which has most confirmed/death cases reported.
Data used for the project are gathered from the following data providers:
  Johns Hopkins University & Medicine
  New York Times
  CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
  Harvard Global Health Institute
  Data SF
  data.gov

Datas used are only upto date till uploaded date.
Please note this is not a live tracker. Only used datas till uploaded date(24th July 2020)
